## Things to be considered 
This Script can be used in any oilrigs you just need to adjust the coords accordingly 
Things to acknowledge when adjusting it to your oilrig:
-> You need to create a outline of your oil rig and enter it in the client (Line 221). This is because i have setup the script so that the bot will spawn when you enter the oil so the outline of oil rig is essential
-> You need to setup the location of where you should be teleported to when you die in the oilrig

## Configuration  
Edit the configuration file (`config.lua`) to customize the script to your server's needs:  
- Dealer locations.  
- Rewards and loot.  
- NPC difficulty and behavior.
